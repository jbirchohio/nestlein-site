### Scoring Algorithm ###
Analyze the data and assign scores (from 1 to 10) for the following categories:
 1. Food/Quality (taste, freshness, presentation)
 2. Service (friendliness, speed, attentiveness)
 3. Ambiance/Atmosphere (cleanliness, décor, vibe, noise level)
 4. Value (worth the cost, portion size, overall pricing)
 5. Experience (overall enjoyment, standout moments or issues)

Calculate the **Final Score** as the average of these five categories, rounded to one decimal place.
Output the final score as:
**Final Score**: [score]/10
